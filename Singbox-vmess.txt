I'm happy to help you with your request. Based on web search results, **reality xray** is a network tool that uses the **Xray-core** and **REALITY** protocol to provide a fast and secure proxy service¹. **Vmess** is a protocol that supports multiple transport modes, such as TCP, WebSocket, HTTP/2, etc¹. **Sing-box** is a cross-platform GUI proxy configuration manager that supports various protocols, such as Shadowsocks, Trojan, V2Ray, etc².

To configure reality xray in vmess protocol with sing-box, you may need to follow these steps:

- Install sing-box on your device. You can find the installation instructions for different platforms on GitHub².
- Install reality xray on your device. You can also find the installation instructions on GitHub¹.
- Launch sing-box and add a new outbound proxy. Choose vmess as the protocol and enter the server address, port, user ID, security type and other settings as required.
- Save the configuration and test the connection.

I hope this helps you. If you have any further questions, please let me know.

Sure, I can show you an example of vmess settings. Based on web search results, vmess settings are usually written in JSON format and contain the following fields¹:

- **address**: the server address or domain name
- **port**: the server port
- **id**: the user ID or UUID
- **alterId**: the number of alternative IDs
- **security**: the encryption method
- **network**: the transport mode, such as tcp, ws, h2, etc
- **tls**: whether to enable TLS or not

Here is an example of vmess settings for a client³:

```json
{
  "outbounds": [
    {
      "protocol": "vmess",
      "settings": {
        "vnext": [
          {
            "address": "example.com",
            "port": 443,
            "users": [
              {
                "id": "23ad6b10-8d1a-40f7-8ad0-e3e35cd38297",
                "alterId": 64,
                "security": "auto"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      "streamSettings": {
        "network": "ws",
        "security": "tls",
        "wsSettings": {
          "path": "/ray"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This means that the client will connect to the server with the domain name example.com and the port 443 using vmess protocol. The user ID is 23ad6b10-8d1a-40f7-8ad0-e3e35cd38297 and the alterId is 64. The encryption method is auto and the transport mode is WebSocket with TLS enabled. The WebSocket path is /ray.

I hope this example helps you understand vmess settings better. If you need more help, please let me know.
